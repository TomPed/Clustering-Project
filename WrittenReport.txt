  One important question in clustering algorithms is the choice of ”best” k.
  Discuss the pros and cons of using purity as the basis for choosing the
  optimal k.

  PROS:
    As purity increases
    1. Less variation in clusters
    2. Less error if you create "something*" for each cluster


  CONS:
    As purity increases
    1. More clusters = more "somethings*" you need to make
    2. There is less compression of the data

    * can be any accessory that needs to be created for a
      product. i.e. phone chargers for phones.

4.
  Given the purities calculated for k = 1, 2, . . . , N , propose
  method to choose the optimal k for your clustering algorithm.

  If you were to look at the KvPurityGraph.png and imagine the
  line as a nice smooth curve and choose the point where the
  derivative of the graph is 1, in my case about: k = 200.
